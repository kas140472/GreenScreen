# Green Screen

Upload the foreground image (an image with a green (more green than red or blue) background) and the background image. The Green Screen algorithm will replace the foreground images's background with the background image. The foreground and background images must be of the same size.

This webpage uses the dukelearntoprogram SimpleImage library's methods to manipulate image pixels and JavaScript functions to code the Green Screen algorithm. Part of w3Schools' CSS template has been used for webpage design.
